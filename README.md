# Welcome to Tic Tac Toe

## About This Project

This project is built using the Big Three: HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS...Okay, I used SASS, you caught me. I like it a lot.It is served by Netlify on the backend for a simple, fast, reliable, serverless experience that I can depend on.

## Lessons Learned
- **Animations With Purpose**  - Rather than just putting in animations to make things look pretty, several of the animations in this game are used to convey meaning. The placement of a mark comes in with a small animation that notifies the user that they have indeed confirmed their selection. But, perhaps more important than that is the winning animation that notifies the players of a winning move. This makes the animation functional rather than just cute

- **Unique Color Palette** - On this project, I wanted to use an atypical color palette. I always have trouble convincing myself that it is okay to get away from a monochramatic scheme or a more traditional set of colors. I ended up finding a random color scheme generator that spat out the color scheme you see on this project. Now that I see the colors getting along with each other on the page, it is funny thinking of myself staring at the palette and thinking I could never get them to work together.

- **Return to Your Roots** - It is often joked about but it's true: Rarely do I find myself using vanilla JS all by itself. For that reason, I wanted to "get away from it all" and use some vanilla JS just for kicks. It is funny looking back at how we started and seeing how far we have come in such a short time. The developer experience, the performance, everything about what the JS community has come up with to make Javascript so strong is truly amazing.

## Challenges & Improvements Ahead
- **Use a Class?** - I have not looked at classes enough to know how to use them outside of React but it would appear to me that this Tac Tic Toe game is ripe for creating a class. This would give the game a little bit of modularity and, more importantly, give me the opportunity to earn about classes outside of React.

- **Computer Opponent** - I definitely need to make a computer opponent to play against. Ya know, for the lonely people out there. :) But, really, creating an "AI" opponent would be a great test in my logic skills and seeing how well I could get a function to try to defend itself from losing...Or even win.

- **Cancel Hover Animation on Already Selected Square** - Title! The orange highlighting that occurs on hover of a game square doesn't exactly make sense if that square is already selected on a previous play. The highlight was supposed to give extra context to the player that the square is something they can and should click on but, with an X or O already occupying that square, this behavior could and should be prevented.
